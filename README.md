# HSPF BIS2151 Testat2
 
This is the second of five practical examinations carried out as part of the course *'Introduction to Programming'* at Pforzheim University in the Summer term of 2020. 

Over the course of the semester, students are grouped in teams of two and asked to complete various tasks related to object-oriented programming.

Our team, consisting of Lukas Gabriel and Cedric Jansen, chose GitHub for Version Control to make collaboration easier. Now that we passed all five examinations, we want to share our code with other students of later semesters who might be faced with similar tasks.

The learning objective of **Testat #2** is as follows:
*"[The students] perform research in the Java Documentation successfully, [...] can program method calls [and] create a more sophisticated program"*

While Tasks One and Two are of theoretical nature, Task Three requires the students to implement a simple command-line application in Java called 'Lotto Machine' that generates random numbers in a Lotto-type fashion. Furthermore, a method that tests this machine should be programmed.

The complete task description can be found in 'Testat_2.pdf'

We implemented both methods in Java (*src\main\java\de\hspforzheim\testat\LottoMachine.java*) and Python (*etc\lotto_machine.py*).

Additionally, we developed a simple web application that implements the Testat 2 tasks with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and designed a simple graphical user interface:

This version is accessible via *html\index.html*.

Our submission was graded with 5.75 out of 6 possible points.
