### **Task 1:**  
If you can read this, Task 1 was submitted.

---

### **Task 2:**

#### Math:
1.  `pow(double a, double b)` : The static `pow()` method of the Math class
       raises a to the power of b and returns a double as result.
       --> a multiplied b times with itself.

2.   The method is names `abs()` and can be used by calling `Math.abs()`
3.   `public static final double PI` --> **3.141592653589793**  *"The double value that is closer than any other to pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter."*

#### String:
4.  Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.
5.  `public String toLowerCase()` can be used to lowercase all letters of 
        a string.
        just like `split()`, this is an instance method and needs a String 
        to be called.

#### BigInteger:
6.  `public boolean isProbablePrime(int certainty)` 
        can be used for that.
        --> *"Returns true if this *BigInteger* is probably prime, false if it's 
        definitely composite. If certainty is â‰¤ 0, true is returned."*
        
#### Thread:
7.  `public static void sleep(long millis)`
                  throws `InterruptedException` --> can be used to to let a programm sleep for a certain number of milliseconds. Can be used on different, instantiated Threads or the main Thread of course.

#### General Java research:
8.  Every Java class (except the Object class itself) inherits from the 
       *Object* class.

### LottoMachine Code:

#### To change LottoMachine parameters:


Call 
`LottoMachine.setParameters(lottoBalls, lottoLowerBound, lottoUpperBound, sortLotto);`

#### Arguments:

- `lottoBalls`: the amount of ball rolls *(real world: 6)*
- `lottoLowerBound`: the lowest number on any ball *(real world: 1)*
- `lottoUpperBound`: the highest number on any ball *(real world: 49)*
- `sortLotto`: should the representation of the lotto result be sorted? *(real world: yes)*

#### Example (with default values):
```java 
myLotto.setParameters(6, 1, 49, false);
```
