Task 1:
If you can read this, Task 1 was submitted.

Task 2:

Math:
    1. pow(double a, double b) : The static pow() method of the Math class
       raises a to the power of b and returns a double as result.
       --> a multiplied b times with itself.

    2.  the method is names abs() and can be used by calling Math.abs()
    3.  public static final double	PI	3.141592653589793
        "The double value that is closer than any other to pi, 
         the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter."

String:
    4. Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.
    5. public String toLowerCase() can be used to lowercase all letters of 
        a string.
        just like split(), this is an instance method and needs a String 
        to be called.

BigInteger:
    6. public boolean isProbablePrime(int certainty) can be used for that.
    --> "Returns true if this BigInteger is probably prime, false if it's 
        definitely composite. If certainty is â‰¤ 0, true is returned."
        
Thread:
    7. public static void sleep(long millis)
                  throws InterruptedException
       
        can be used to to let a programm sleep for a certain number of 
        milliseconds. Can be used on different, instantiated Threads or the
        main Thread of course.

General Java research:
    8. Every Java class (except the Object class itself) inherits from the 
       Object class.
