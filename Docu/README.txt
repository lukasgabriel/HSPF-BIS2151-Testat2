Once again, in the /etc/ folder, you can find a Python implementation of the program that we did after we were finished with the Java version.
Like last time, this does not affect the Java implementation, we merely did this for fun. In addition, we added a little html web application
that generates and displays lotto numbers as 'lotto machine. ;-)

Best Wishes,
Cedric & Lukas
